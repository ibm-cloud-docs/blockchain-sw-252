## IBM Blockchain Platform (v2.5.x)
{: #kc-content-1}

The {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Blockchain Platform continues to grow its presence in multicloud and is now available to run on any Kubernetes v1.20 - v1.23 container platform on x86_64 hardware or on s390x on OpenShift Container Platform 4.5 to 4.7 running LinuxONE. This includes environments outside the IBM and Red Hat ecosystem like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This offering is ideal if you want to deploy your components, store your data, or run your workloads on your own infrastructure or across public and private clouds for security, risk mitigation, preference, or compliance reasons.

Your entitlement includes the peer, Certificate Authority, ordering node, and smart contract container images as well as the award-winning flexible management console for deploying and managing your blockchain network. Use the console or IBM Blockchain Platform APIs to build a consortium of organizations to easily transact on the same network, regardless of each member's cloud preference. You can build, operate, and grow your blockchain networks with an offering that can be used from development to production.

The platform contains multiple key features to support your various business requirements that include:
- **BUILD** - Integrated developer experience. Use the IBM Blockchain Platform Developer Tools to develop smart contracts locally. You can also benefit from simplified DevOps and integrated Kubernetes services and choose which version of Hyperledger Fabric you want to use when you deploy your peers and ordering nodes, while new Ansible Galaxy playbooks allow you to script your deployment of components.
- **OPERATE** - Total control of your deployments. In the IBM Blockchain Platform console, you can easily create, manage, operate, and monitor identities, user accesses, and network components in your network.
- **GROW** - Scalability and flexibility. You can choose the environment and compute to build and scale your network. High availability (HA) can be configured to ensure the resilience of your network.

and [Getting Started with IBM Blockchain Platform](/docs/blockchain-sw-252?topic=blockchain-sw-252-get-started-console-ocp).


If you are an experienced Hyperledger Fabric customer and prefer to deploy and manage the containers yourself, you can download and use the container images without the management console.
For more information about using the downloading just the images, see [Using the IBM Blockchain images for Hyperledger Fabric](/docs/blockchain-sw-252?topic=blockchain-sw-252-blockchain-images).
