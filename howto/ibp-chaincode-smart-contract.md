# Running the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform with self-managed Kubernetes smart contracts
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed}

The aim of this is to show how with {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.5.2, the Chaincode containers that run smart contracts can be run in a namespace of your own choosing in Kubernetes. This is a new feature of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform and is made possible by the underlying Hyperledger Fabric - External Chaincode and Chaincode-as-a-server features.

Objectives:
- Set up an Ansible based environment to use for configuration
- Build a NodeJS smart contract in a Docker image and push the image to the repository
- Using the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Ansible collection, provision a basic network of Peers and Orderers
- Provision the Kubernetes resources needed to run the Docker image
- Create the secrets needed to retrieve the image
- Deployment of the actual chaincode
- Testing it!

## Before you begin
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-before}

First, access to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to set up the free Kubernetes cluster. Free access to the Kubernetes cluster valid for 28 days. After Kubernetes cluster setup finishes, install the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform into the cluster.

### Suitable Python Environment
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-before-python}

Ansible is a main feature for this setup. As Ansible is written in Python, therefore, getting a Python environment is essential. Setup of Python can be time consuming and awkward. The easier way to do this successfully is to use pipenv.

To get started, use the following sequence of commands:

```bash
pipenv --python 3.8
pipenv install fabric-sdk-py
pipenv install 'openshift==0.11.2'
pipenv install jq
ansible-galaxy collection install ibm.blockchain_platform community.kubernetes moreati.jq ibmcloud.collection
# add --force to get upgrade to new versions of these collections
```
{: codeblock}

Finally, run `pipenv shell` to get into a shell that has the mandate python configuration.

### More tools
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-before-tools}

- Nodejs (version 12+). Suggested that uses `nvm` for this
- [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started)
- Install the Container Registry and Kubernetes Service [plug-ins](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-devtools-manually)
- Docker for building the containers
- More NodeJS utilities that are required are listed as follows. Install them as needed.

### Hyperledger Fabric Peer Commands
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-before-hyperledger}

A copy of the [Hyperleger Fabric](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/cc_service.html) Peer Commands is required. Use script `getPeer.sh` to get them.

```bash
getPeer.sh
peer version

# output. need to have 2.2.1 or later
peer:
 Version: 2.2.1
 Commit SHA: 344fda602
 Go version: go1.14.4
 OS/Arch: linux/amd64
 Chaincode:
  Base Docker Label: org.hyperledger.fabric
  Docker Namespace: hyperledger
```
{: codeblock}


## API Keys
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-api}

There are also 2 required API keys for {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} console service credentials that need to be created:

1. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API Key that can be [created from the web ui](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials)
2. A [User API Key](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#manage-user-keys)


Create a `.env` file that is similar to this:

```
# .env file
CLOUD_API_KEY=a8aUjPRMrIgLhQXGWcl9tR_FxtdQvjQtmPXnKrFHQIK5
IBP_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
IBP_ENDPOINT=https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-ibpconsole-console.so01.blockchain.test.cloud.ibm.com
```
{: codeblock}

Then, set the following as environment variables.

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```
{: codeblock}

## Node.js smart contract
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-nodejs}

To demonstrate how to deploy a contract, here uses an example, which is the basic getting started contract that is found in the Fabric Docs and the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform VSCode extensions. The key is the Dockerfile that is also part of the contract, and some minor changes to the package.json

### Chaincode-as-a-server
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-nodejs-chaincode}

Under normal circumstances, the Peers start (directly or indirectly in the case like {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform) the chaincode processes running. In this case, when the chaincode starts it 'calls back' to the peer to 'register'.

Here becomes a different situation whereas the chaincode process becomes a server, and it is up to the peer to connect to it when it needs to 'register'.

After the initial 'registration' is complete, there should be no difference between the two setups.

The key is to add the following script to the package.json scripts section.

```
 "start:server": "fabric-chaincode-node server --chaincode-address=$CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS --chaincode-id=$CHAINCODE_ID"
```
{: codeblock}

Suggest adding `echo $CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS $CHAINCODE_ID && ` before the command `fabric-chaincode-node` for debugging purposes.

*Note* There are NO changes to the actual contract or libraries used. The only change is the preceding command in the `package.json`

### Dockerfile
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-nodejs-dockerfile}


The Dockerfile is a relatively simple node.js file where you can develop as your need.

```
FROM node:12.15-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json first to check if an npm install is needed
COPY package.json /usr/src/app
RUN npm install --production

# Bundle app source
COPY . /usr/src/app

ENV PORT 9999
EXPOSE 9999

CMD ["npm", "run", "start:server"]
```
{: codeblock}

Notice that the PORT is set as 9999 and run the command. Most important is to ensure that the command is running and the port is set up. The port can be of your own choice and 9999 is used in the following example.

Then, you need to build and push this to a registry. The registry used in the container registry that is connected to the IBM Kubernetes Cluster.

```
docker build -t caasdemo-node .
docker tag caasdemo-node stg.icr.io/ibp_demo/caasdemo-node:latest
```
{: codeblock}


```
ibmcloud cr login
docker push  stg.icr.io/ibp_demo/caasdemo-node:latest
```
{: codeblock}


## Secret to pull the docker image
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-secret}

See [Creating an image pull secret with different IAM API key credentials for more control or access to images in other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-registry#other_registry_accounts) for more information.

The required commands are in the `createIAMSecret.sh` script. It needs to run only once.

## {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Configuration
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-ibpconfig}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Ansible collection is used here. The playbook that creates the Peers or Orders needs to run first.

As {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Playbooks are concerned, the following is the standard.
```
ansible-playbook ./config/ansible-playbooks/000-create-network.yml \
    --extra-vars api_key=${IBP_KEY} \
    --extra-vars api_endpoint=${IBP_ENDPOINT} \
    --extra-vars api_token_endpoint=${API_TOKEN_ENDPOINT} \
    --extra-vars channel_name=${CHANNEL_NAME} \
    --extra-vars home_dir=${DIR}
```
{: codeblock}

Next step is to set up the chaincode, which is different from the usual as follows:

```
ansible-playbook ./config/ansible-playbooks/001-setup-k8s-chaincode.yml \
    --extra-vars api_key=${IBP_KEY} \
    --extra-vars api_endpoint=${IBP_ENDPOINT} \
    --extra-vars api_token_endpoint=${API_TOKEN_ENDPOINT} \
    --extra-vars channel_name=${CHANNEL_NAME} \
    --extra-vars smart_contract_name=nodecontract \
    --extra-vars smart_contract_version=2 \
    --extra-vars smart_contract_sequence=2 \
    --extra-vars home_dir=${DIR} \
```
{: codeblock}

### Playbook details
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-ibpconfig-playbook}

This is the `001-setup-k8s-chaincode.yml` playbook.

Kubernetes namespace - first is to create a namespace separate from the running {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform instance.

```yaml
    - name: Setup the namepsace
      community.kubernetes.k8s:
        name: caasdemo
        api_version: v1
        kind: Namespace
        state: present
```
{: codeblock}

Service instance - most important is the peer to locate the chaincode and connect. This is done from a Service and by using a ClusterIP type service. The port here is the same as previous and is changed if needed.

```yaml
    - name: Create a Service object from an inline definition
      community.kubernetes.k8s:
        state: present
        definition:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            namespace: caasdemo
            name: nodecc
            labels:
              app: caasdemo
          spec:
            ports:
            - name: chaincode
              port: 9999
              targetPort: 9999
              protocol: TCP
            selector:
              app: caasdemo
      register: result
```
{: codeblock}

'Proxy' chaincode - needs to install a 'proxy' chaincode to indicate where the chaincode is running. The 'code' is a JSON file - `connection.json`. Following are the two steps to create this file and packaging it up as an 'external chaincode'.

```yaml
    - copy:
        content: "{{ result.result.spec | moreati.jq.jq('{address: \"nodecc.caasdemo:9999\",dial_timeout:\"10s\",tls_required:false}') }}"
        dest: ./connection.json
    - name: Create the archive
      command: ../pkgcc.sh -l nodecontract -t external connection.json
```
{: codeblock}

Install, approve, and commit - the chaincode needs to be installed, approved, and committed. This is a standard use of the ansible tasks that can be used sequentially here. However, if this is in a multi organizational environment, this needs to be handled differently.

Chaincode configuration - the actual running chaincode needs to know its 'name'. This is assigned by the peer in the previous installation step and can be captured in ansible to put into a configmap.

*Note* This is Node chaincode, so the `CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS` is `0.0.0.0` again with the port 9999.  

```yaml
    - name: Create a ConfigMap for the chaincode configuration
      community.kubernetes.k8s:
        state: present
        definition:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: ConfigMap
          metadata:
            name: nodecc.v5.conf
            namespace: caasdemo
            labels:
              app:  caasdemo
          data:
            CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS: 0.0.0.0:9999
            CHAINCODE_ID: "{{ installcc_result.installed_chaincode.package_id }}"
```
{: codeblock}

Deploying the chaincode - Finally, the chaincode is ready for deployment and get it to run.

```yaml
    - name: Create a ConfigMap for the chaincode configuration
      community.kubernetes.k8s:
        state: present
        definition:
          apiVersion: apps/v1
          kind: Deployment
          metadata:
            namespace: caasdemo
            name: caasdemo
            labels:
              app: caasdemo
          spec:
            replicas: 1
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: caasdemo
            template:
              metadata:
                labels:
                  app: caasdemo
              spec:
                containers:
                  - name: nodecc
                    image: stg.icr.io/ibp_demo/caasdemo-node          
                    resources:
                      requests:
                        memory: "50Mi"
                        cpu: "0.1"
                    ports:
                    - containerPort: 9999
                    envFrom:
                      - configMapRef:
                          name: nodecc.v5.conf
                imagePullSecrets:
                  - name: pullimg-secret
```
{: codeblock}

A few items are tied together:

- The Docker image name of the container and the secret that is used to pull this from the registry
- The port is used
- The configmap is used to configure the environment

## Checkpoint
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-checkpoint}

By now, you achieved the following:

- Created and built a Nodejs smart contract and produced a Docker image to host it (the chaincode).
- This pushed to the docker registry. Created and used the secret for pulling the image.
- Use Ansible to create the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network and installed a proxy chaincode.
- The config maps from Kubernetes resources created and deployed the service.

Next steps are to create an identity, and use that to submit transactions

## Create identities
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-createidentities}

The Ansible playbook `002-create-identity.yml` that creates an identity to make it available for use with Client-side applications.

```bash
ansible-playbook ./config/ansible-playbooks/002-create-identity.yml \
    --extra-vars id_name="fred" \
    --extra-vars api_key=${IBP_KEY} \
    --extra-vars api_endpoint=${IBP_ENDPOINT} \
    --extra-vars api_token_endpoint=${API_TOKEN_ENDPOINT} \
    --extra-vars channel_name=${CHANNEL_NAME} \
    --extra-vars home_dir=${DIR} \
    --extra-vars network_name=CAASDEMO \
    --extra-vars org1_name=CAASOrg1 \
    --extra-vars org1_msp_id=CAASOrg1MSP
```
{: codeblock}

The first half of this playbook uses the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform collection to create the identity. The second half is using a community utility to take the identities from {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform and create a local wallet for use by the Fabric Client SDKs.

(If `npm install -g @hyperledgendary/weftility` is not yet installed)

The `_cfg` creates the directory that contains a connection profile and a couple of wallets to use with the 'fred' identity.  

## Using these identities
{: #ibp-smart-contracts-k8s-self-managed-usingidentities}

Next, and final step is to send some actual transactions. You can now decide to write your own client app, or use the VSCode extension, or use an already written client-side app.  

To begin, install `runhfsc`

```
npm install -g @hyperledgednary/runhfsc
runhfsc --gateway ./_cfg/ansible/_gateways/CAASDEMO_CAASOrg1.json --wallet ./_cfg/ansible/_wallets/CAASDEMO_CAASOrg1 --user fred --channel caaschannel
```
{: codeblock}

A command will prompt and if you enter `contract nodecontract`, this connects to {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform.

Then, if you enter `metadata` it issues a transaction to query the metadata of the contract (if it works, then, you get a full end-end connectivity)

```
 contract nodecontract
Contract set to nodecontract
[default] fred@caaschannel:nodecontract - $ metadata
(node:22057) [DEP0123] DeprecationWarning: Setting the TLS ServerName to an IP address is not permitted by RFC 6066. This will be ignored in a future versi
on.
> {
  '$schema': 'https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-chaincode-node/release-2.1/api/contract-schema.json',
  contracts: {
    MyAssetContract: {
      name: 'MyAssetContract',
      contractInstance: { name: 'MyAssetContract', default: true },
      .....
      .....
```
{: codeblock}

Following is a simple asset creation example for creating an asset:
```
submit createMyAsset '["007","Bond James Bond"]'
{
  txname: 'createMyAsset',
  args: '["007","Bond James Bond"]',
  private: undefined
}
Submitted createMyAsset  007,Bond James Bond
>
````
{: codeblock}

And to read the asset back again

```
evaluate readMyAsset '["007"]'
Submitted readMyAsset  007
> {"value":"Bond James Bond"}
```
{: codeblock}

Reading an asset that does not exist (or maybe not have clearance to know about?)
```
 evaluate readMyAsset '["004"]'ß
Submitted readMyAsset  004
Error: error in simulation: transaction returned with failure: Error: The my asset 004 does not exist
```
{: codeblock}
